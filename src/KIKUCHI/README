The program to calculate the Green's function was developed by Porf. M. Kikuchi and Porf. H. Kanamori.
Kikuchi-sensei was my supervisor. Unfortunately, I cannot report on how PDTI developed with Kikuchi-sensei and share in the joy of seeing it completed..... However, without Kikuchi-seisei's guidance,I would not have been able to develop PDTI. 
Prof. Kanamori has kindly agreed to release to the public a modified version of the Green's function program.
I am grateful to Prof. Kanamori for his support and to Kikuchi-sensei for his warm supervision.
